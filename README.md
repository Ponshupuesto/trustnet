🧩 1. What is Trustnet?
Trustnet is a platform for creating and managing organized, participatory, and secure networks — designed for individuals, communities, and organizations that want to collaborate, make decisions, and build together in a transparent and decentralized way.

👥 2. Who is it for?
Trustnet is designed for a wide range of users and communities, including:

Neighborhood or citizen organizations

Cultural or social collectives

Fandoms and global fan communities

Content creators and influencers

Student or academic groups

Civil associations, cooperatives, and NGOs

Work teams, DAOs, and Web3 networks

🧰 3. What can you do with Trustnet?
Each network created on Trustnet can:

Create proposals and put them to a vote

Assign roles and responsibilities

Share calendars, agreements, and progress

Report local issues (such as service failures) and track their resolution

Organize contests, raffles, campaigns, or events

Connect with other networks to collaborate

Manage funds with full transparency

Communicate directly without intermediaries

🌐 4. Secure and decentralized technology
Trustnet is built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), which ensures:

Security and sovereignty over your data

Full transparency: everything is auditable by participants

Autonomy: each network defines how it governs itself

Scalability without relying on centralized servers

🧭 5. Bridging people to the Web3 world
One of Trustnet’s core goals is to facilitate the gradual adoption of Web3 technologies.
Thanks to its flexible governance models (consultative, participatory, DAO), users can start with simple structures and evolve at their own pace toward more decentralized systems.

🌍 6. Small networks, collective impact
We believe true change begins locally:
small, organized networks equipped with real tools that can connect and scale together.

Whether it’s a neighborhood community, an artistic collective, a fan group, or a creator’s audience — Trustnet enables people to join forces and create greater impact.

💡 7. More than a platform: an ecosystem of tools
Beyond internal organization, Trustnet also provides:

Modules for community participation

Shared tools across networks

Future possibility of launching community crowdfunding campaigns

Impact visualization and public transparency



If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background
```
To interact with the ledger locally, you can check the following link: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-4/4.1-icp-ledger

Still, here’s a quick summary: it’s necessary to create two identities.

```bash
dfx identity new minter --storage-mode plaintext
dfx identity use minter
export MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID=$(dfx ledger account-id)
```
Any transfer made from the minting account will make a Mint transaction, while transfers to the minting account will make a Burn transaction.

Then switch to another identity that will receive the minted tokens, use:

```bash
export DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID=$(dfx ledger account-id)
```
Now you just need to run:

```bash
dfx deploy --specified-id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai icp_ledger_canister --argument "(variant { Init = record { minting_account = "$MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID"; initial_values = vec { record { "$DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID"; record { e8s = 10_000_000_000 : nat64; }; }; }; send_whitelist = vec {}; transfer_fee = opt record { e8s = 10_000 : nat64; }; token_symbol = opt "LICP"; token_name = opt "Local ICP"; }})"
```
And you can transfer to the accounts you created in the app. To see the balance in the profile, there's still a lot to do, but we hope to keep working to bring Trustnet to life.


Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
